<A NAME="@default172"></A></P><P>At many American colleges and universities, the student-to-faculty
ratio is about 10:1. But students are often surprised to discover
that their average class size is bigger than 10. There
are two reasons for the discrepancy:</P><UL CLASS="itemize"><LI CLASS="li-itemize">Students typically take 4&#X2013;5 classes per semester, but
professors often teach 1 or 2.</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">The number of students who enjoy a small class is small,
but the number of students in a large class is (ahem!) large.</LI></UL><P>The first effect is obvious (at least once it is pointed out);
the second is more subtle. So let&#X2019;s look at an example. Suppose
that a college offers 65 classes in a given semester, with the
following distribution of sizes:
</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim"> size      count
 5- 9          8
10-14          8
15-19         14
20-24          4
25-29          6
30-34         12
35-39          8
40-44          3
45-49          2
</PRE><P>If you ask the Dean for the average class size, he would
construct a PMF, compute the mean, and report that the
average class size is 24.</P><P>But if you survey a group of students, ask them how many
students are in their classes, and compute the mean, you would
think that the average class size was higher.</P><DIV CLASS="theorem"><B>Exercise&#XA0;1</B>&#XA0;&#XA0;<EM>
Build a PMF of these data and compute the mean as perceived by the
Dean. Since the data have been grouped in bins, you can use the
mid-point of each bin.
</EM><A NAME="@default173"></A><P><EM>Now find the distribution of class sizes as perceived by students
and compute its mean. </EM></P><P><EM>Suppose you want to find the distribution of class sizes at a
college, but you can&#X2019;t get reliable data from the Dean.
An alternative is to choose a random sample of students and ask them
the number of students in each of their classes. Then you could compute
the PMF of their responses.
</EM><A NAME="@default174"></A>
<A NAME="@default175"></A></P><P><EM>The result would be biased because large classes
would be oversampled, but you could estimate the actual
distribution of class sizes by applying an appropriate transformation
to the observed distribution.</EM></P><P><EM>Write a function called <CODE>UnbiasPmf</CODE> that takes the PMF of the
observed values and returns a new Pmf object that estimates the
distribution of class sizes.</EM></P><P><EM>You can download a solution to this problem from

<A NAME="relay"></A><P><EM>In most foot races, everyone starts at the same time. If you are a
fast runner, you usually pass a lot of people at the beginning of the
race, but after a few miles everyone around you is going at the same
speed.
</EM><A NAME="@default177"></A>
<A NAME="@default178"></A>
<A NAME="@default179"></A></P><P><EM>When I ran a long-distance (209 miles) relay race for the first
time, I noticed an odd phenomenon: when I overtook another runner, I
was usually much faster, and when another runner overtook me, he was
usually much faster.</EM></P><P><EM>At first I thought that the distribution of speeds might be bimodal;
that is, there were many slow runners and many fast runners, but few
at my speed.</EM></P><P><EM>Then I realized that I was the victim of selection bias. The race
was unusual in two ways: it used a staggered start, so teams started
at different times; also, many teams included runners at different
levels of ability.
</EM><A NAME="@default180"></A>
<A NAME="@default181"></A></P><P><EM>As a result, runners were spread out along the course with little
relationship between speed and location. When I started running my
leg, the runners near me were (pretty much) a random sample of the
runners in the race.</EM></P><P><EM>So where does the bias come from? During my time on the course, the
chance of overtaking a runner, or being overtaken, is proportional to
the difference in our speeds. To see why, think about the extremes.
If another runner is going at the same speed as me, neither of us will
overtake the other. If someone is going so fast that they cover the
entire course while I am running, they are certain to overtake me.</EM></P><P><EM>Write a function called <TT>BiasPmf</TT> that takes a Pmf representing
the actual distribution of runners&#X2019; speeds, and the speed of a running
observer, and returns a new Pmf representing the distribution of
runners&#X2019; speeds as seen by the observer.</EM></P><P><EM>To test your function, get the distribution of speeds from a
normal road race (not a relay). I wrote a program that reads the
results from the James Joyce Ramble 10K in Dedham MA and converts the
pace of each runner to MPH. Download it from
<TT>http://thinkstats.com/relay.py</TT>. Run it and look at the PMF of
speeds.
</EM><A NAME="@default182"></A>
<A NAME="@default183"></A></P><P><EM>Now compute the distribution of speeds you would observe if you ran a
relay race at 7.5 MPH with this group of runners. You can download a
solution from <TT>http://thinkstats.com/relay_soln.py</TT></EM></P></DIV><H2 CLASS="section"><A NAME="toc24"></A><A NAME="htoc25">3.2</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;The limits of PMFs</H2><P>
<A NAME="@default184"></A></P><P>PMFs work well if the number of values is small. But as the
number of values increases, the probability associated with each value
gets smaller and the effect of random noise increases.</P><P>For example, we might be interested in the distribution of birth
weights. In the NSFG data, the variable <CODE>totalwgt_oz</CODE> records
weight at birth in ounces. Figure&#XA0;<A HREF="#nsfg_birthwgt_pmf">3.1</A> shows the
PMF of these values for first babies and others.

<DIV CLASS="center"><HR WIDTH="80%" SIZE=2></DIV></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Overall, these distributions resemble the familiar &#X201C;bell curve,&#X201D; with
many values near the mean and a few values much higher and lower.</P><P>But parts of this figure are hard to interpret. There are many spikes
and valleys, and some apparent differences between the distributions.
It is hard to tell which of these features are significant. Also, it
is hard to see overall patterns; for example, which distribution do
you think has the higher mean?
<A NAME="@default189"></A></P><P>These problems can be mitigated by binning the data;
that is, dividing the domain into non-overlapping intervals and counting
the number of values in each bin. Binning can be useful, but it is
tricky to get the size of the bins right. If they are big enough to
smooth out noise, they might also smooth out useful information.</P><P>An alternative that avoids these problems is the <B>cumulative
distribution function</B>, or <B>CDF</B>. But before we can get to that,
we have to talk about percentiles.

<A NAME="@default191"></A></P><H2 CLASS="section"><A NAME="toc25"></A><A NAME="htoc26">3.3</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;Percentiles</H2><P>
<A NAME="@default192"></A></P><P>If you have taken a standardized test, you probably got your
results in the form of a raw score and a <B>percentile rank</B>.
In this context, the percentile rank is the fraction of people who
scored lower than you (or the same). So if you are &#X201C;in the 90th
percentile,&#X201D; you did as well as or better than 90% of the people who
took the exam.</P><P>Here&#X2019;s how you could compute the percentile rank of a value,
<CODE>your_score</CODE>, relative to the scores in the sequence <TT>scores</TT>:
</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">def PercentileRank(scores, your_score):
    count = 0
    for score in scores:
        if score &lt;= your_score:
            count += 1

    percentile_rank = 100.0 * count / len(scores)
    return percentile_rank
</PRE><P>For example, if the scores in the sequence were 55, 66, 77, 88 and 99,
and you got the 88, then your percentile rank would be <TT>100 * 4 / 5</TT>
which is 80.</P><P>If you are given a value, it is easy to find its percentile rank; going
the other way is slightly harder. If you are given a percentile rank
and you want to find the corresponding value, one option is to
sort the values and search for the one you want:
</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">def Percentile(scores, percentile_rank):
    scores.sort()
    for score in scores:
        if PercentileRank(scores, score) &gt;= percentile_rank:
            return score
</PRE><P>The result of this calculation is a <B>percentile</B>. For example,
the 50th percentile is the value with percentile rank 50. In the
distribution of exam scores, the 50th percentile is 77.
<A NAME="@default193"></A></P><DIV CLASS="theorem"><B>Exercise&#XA0;3</B>&#XA0;&#XA0;<EM>
This implementation of <TT>Percentile</TT> is not very efficient. A

the corresponding percentile. Write a version of <TT>Percentile</TT> that

<A NAME="@default196"></A>
<A NAME="@default197"></A></P><P>Now that we understand percentiles, we are ready to tackle the
cumulative distribution function (CDF). The CDF is the function that
maps values to their percentile rank in a distribution.</P><P>The CDF is a function of <I>x</I>, where <I>x</I>&#XA0;is any value that might appear
in the distribution. To evaluate CDF(<I>x</I>) for a particular value of
<I>x</I>, we compute the fraction of the values in the sample less than (or
equal to) <I>x</I>.</P><P>Here&#X2019;s what that looks like as a function that takes a sample,
<TT>t</TT>, and a value, <TT>x</TT>:
</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">def Cdf(t, x):
    count = 0.0
    for value in t:
        if value &lt;= x:
            count += 1.0

    prob = count / len(t)
    return prob
</PRE><P>This function should look familiar; it is almost identical to <TT>PercentileRank</TT>, except that the result is in a probability in the
range 0&#X2013;1 rather than a percentile rank in the range 0&#X2013;100.</P><P>As an example, suppose a sample has the values {1, 2, 2, 3, 5}.
Here are some values from its CDF:</P><P>&#XA0;&#XA0; CDF(0)&#XA0;=&#XA0;0 </P><P>&#XA0;&#XA0; CDF(1)&#XA0;=&#XA0;0.2 </P><P>&#XA0;&#XA0; CDF(2)&#XA0;=&#XA0;0.6 </P><P>&#XA0;&#XA0; CDF(3)&#XA0;=&#XA0;0.8 </P><P>&#XA0;&#XA0; CDF(4)&#XA0;=&#XA0;0.8 </P><P>&#XA0;&#XA0; CDF(5)&#XA0;=&#XA0;1 </P><P>We can evaluate the CDF for any value of <I>x</I>, not just
values that appear in the sample.
If <I>x</I>&#XA0;is less than the smallest value in the sample, CDF(<I>x</I>) is 0.
If <I>x</I>&#XA0;is greater than the largest value, CDF(<I>x</I>) is 1.</P><BLOCKQUOTE CLASS="figure"><DIV CLASS="center"><HR WIDTH="80%" SIZE=2></DIV>

this module at <TT>http://thinkstats.com/Cdf.html</TT> and you can download it
from <TT>http://thinkstats.com/Cdf.py</TT>.</P><P>Cdfs are implemented with two sorted lists: <TT>xs</TT>, which contains
the values, and <TT>ps</TT>, which contains the probabilities. The

see other definitions of the median. In particular,
some sources suggest that if you have an even number of elements in
a sample, the median is the average of the middle two elements.
This is an unnecessary special case, and it has the odd effect of
generating a value that is not in the sample. As far
as I&#X2019;m concerned, the median is the 50th percentile. Period.
